The RACECAR dataset is a collection of racing scenarios with full scale and high speed autonomous Indy Lights cars. These vehicles captured a plethora of LiDAR, Camera, Radar, GNSS, and IMU data during the 2021-2022 racing season of the Indy Autonomous Challenge.

This repository contains scripts used to parse the dataset, custom ros messages describing GNSS/IMU/Radar data, and a conversion script that converts ros2 bags to [nuScenes](https://www.nuscenes.org/nuscenes) json files.
